</p><h1>
Longitudinal waves in a long, thin rod
</h1>

<p>
We've been playing with string for many days.
Let's switch to a different medium, 
and a slightly different type of disturbance.
We will examine the behavior of <b>longitudinal waves</b>
moving through a long, thin rod.
Unlike the transverse waves on a string,
longitudinal waves involve the oscillation of 
material along (and against) the direction
of motion of the disturbance.

<p>
You should see our new pal the wave equation show up
as we examine the response of a little section of the rod
to a perturbing force ...

<p>
<a name="forces"> Forces on a little section of a rod </a> 
</p></h4>

<p>
We're going to use two different variables in the following
discussion, both of which describe in some way the
position of a little section of a rod along the x-axis.
Let us therefore define very clearly the meaning of
each one before we start.

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_xz.png" width="725" height="128"></center>


<p>
Consider a long, thin rod of material,
with cross-section area <b>A</b>
and density <b>&#961;</b>.
We'll concentrate on the properties of 
a little section of the rod
which runs from position
<b>x</b>
to
<b>(x + &#916; x)</b>.

</p><p>
<img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/rod_a.png" width="772" height="299">

</p><p>
</p><pre><font size="+2">

  Q:  What is the mass of this little section?







</font></pre>

<p>
Right.

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_dm.png" width="478" height="69"></center>

<p>
Now, we exert a force on one end of the rod.
How does it respond?

</p><p>
<img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/rod_a_f.png" width="894" height="299">

</p><p>
The rod stretches in response to the force.
The amount by which the rod stretches 
depends on how far from the end one looks:
the closer to the end with the force,
the bigger the change in length.

</p><p>
<img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/rod_both.png" width="891" height="561">

</p><p>
Let's call the change in the position of any
point on the rod <b>z</b>.
The closer to the right end of the rod,
the bigger <b>z</b> is.
At the position of the left-hand
edge of our section,
<b>x</b>,
the material deforms by 
<b>z</b>;
but at the right-hand edge of the section,
the material deforms by a slightly larger amount
<b>(z + &#916; z)</b>.

</p><p>
In other words, our little section not only
translates to the right,
but becomes slightly longer, too.

</p><p>
Why does the section elongate?
Because the force pulling on its right-hand side
is slightly bigger than the force pulling
on its left-hand side.
In other words, <b>F<sub>2</sub> &gt; F<sub>1</sub></b>.

</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><hr>
<p>
</p><h4>
<p>
<a name="strain"> Stress, and the reaction to it: strain </a> 
</p></h4>

<p>
You may recall that physicists use the term
<b>stress</b>
to describe the differential force acting
on the two ends of a little section of an object.

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_stress.png" width="627" height="132"></center>

<p>
In response to the stress on an object, 
it may change its shape;
this response is called the 
<b>strain.</b>

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_strain.png" width="690" height="109"></center>

<p>
For many objects,
these two phenomena -- the stress on an object
and the resulting strain --
are related in a simple manner,
at least when the changes in shape 
are very small
compared to the original size of the object.
In general,
the stress is equal to some
<b>elastic modulus</b>
multiplied by the strain.
When the object is long and thin,
and being stretched along its length,
this coefficient is called
<b>Young's modulus</b>.
It is usually labelled with either 
<b>Y</b> or <b>E</b>.

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_y_1.png" width="433" height="70"></center>

<p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_y_2.png" width="506" height="120" border="2"></center>


<p>
The left-hand side of this boxed equation
has the net force on the little section,
divided by area.
That net force, by Newton's Second Law,
is just the mass of the section
times its acceleration in the direction of the rod's length.
In other words,
the acceleration in the <b>z</b> direction.

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_f_ma.png" width="517" height="102"></center>

<p>
So the left-hand side becomes

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_f_ma_2.png" width="485" height="111"></center>


<p>
Now, here comes the tricky part.
On the right hand side of the boxed equation,
there is a term for the
change in <b>z</b>
divided by the change in <b>x</b>.
How large is the change in the stretched distance,
<b>&#916; z</b>,
over the length of our little section?
One way to calculate is 
as the rate at which <b>z</b> is changing with <b>x</b>,
multiplied by the width of our little section:

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_delta_z.png" width="330" height="115"></center>

<p>
</p><blockquote>
<font size="-1">
This should remind you of a similar mathematical technique
we called upon in our previous class meeting,
when 
<a href="http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys283/lectures/string_ii/string_ii.html#tricky">
  discussing the change in slope of a vibrating string. </a>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
When all the distances involved are very small,
and we restrict ourselves to a fixed moment in time,
we can write this using the second derivative of
<b>z</b>
with respect to 
<b>x</b>.

<p>
<a name="diffq"> The differential equation of motion </a>

<p>
So, if we use these relationships, 
Newton's Second Law for the motion of this
little section of the rod turns into

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/eqn_diffq_a.png" width="1071" height="109"></center>

<p>
Putting this into the standard form,
with second SPATIAL derivative on the left
and second TEMPORAL derivative on the right,
we end with the wave equation for
longitudinal waves travelling down a long, thin rod.
Remember, 
<b>z</b> 
is defined as the displacement of some tiny piece
of the rod away from its equilibrium position;
it runs parallel to the <b>x</b>-direction.

  Q:  What is the speed of these waves?









</font></pre>

<p>
Yes, the speed of the waves is given by

</p><h4>
<a name="modes">
The normal modes of a rod clamped at one end
</a>
</h4>

<p>
As you might guess, there are certain special modes --
<b>normal modes</b> --
of vibration in which all parts of the rod oscillate
with the same frequency <b>&#969;</b>.
What are the frequencies corresponding to these modes?

</p><p>
In this case, the easiest way to find them is to skip
the mathematics and look at the physical situation.
Suppose that we clamp one end of the rod, 
holding it perfectly still and preventing 
it from vibrating.
The material throughout the rest of the rod
may vibrate,
and the material at the right end of the rod
is free to vibrate as well.

</p><p>
<img src="./1d_wave_deriv_files/clamp_a.png" width="917" height="353">

</p><p>
In this case, any oscillations must
have amplitude zero
at the left (clamped) end of the rod,
but maximum amplitude at the right (un-clamped)
end of the rod.
The lowest normal mode, aka the fundamental mode,
must therefore have an amplitude which looks like this.
In the figure below,
the <i> vertical</i> position of the green line away from
the mid-point of the rod denotes the 
amplitude of the <i>horizontal</i> motions.
Yes, it's awkward to try to draw longitudinal vibrations.

This time, 
let's hold the rod at its middle,
rather than at one end.
Now, the amplitude of oscillation must be zero
at the center of the rod,
but must be a maximum at both ends.
